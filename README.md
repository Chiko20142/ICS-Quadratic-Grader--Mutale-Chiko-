#PROJECT TITLE 
Quadratic Solver and Grading System Web Page
#Brief Description
A single - web page (index.html) that includes two tools:
1. Quadratic Solver:Calculates roots of a quadratic equation given coefficients a, b, c.
2. Grading System: Converts a numerical score to a letter grade with a short message.
#How to Run
1. DOwnload or clone the repository.
2. Open index.html in a web(works offline).
#Test Cases
1. Quadratic Solver:
   * a = 1, b = 5, c = 1 should give roots -2 and -3.
   * a = 1, b = 2, c = 1 should give one repeated root -1.
2. Grading System:
   * Score 85 should print A+
   * Score 75 should print A
   * Score 65 should print B+
   * Score 60 should print B
   * Score 55 should print C+
   * Score 50 should prnt C
   * Score 49 should print D
